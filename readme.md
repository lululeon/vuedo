# vue concepts
- vue directives (v-model, v-for, etc)
  - v-model (two-way binding)
  - v-for
    - example: `<li v-for="task in tasks">{{ task.taskName }}</li>`
    - or: `<li v-for="task in tasks" v-text="task.taskName"></li>`
  - v-text (text value of element - one-way binding)
  - v-on (event listeners, eg click)
    - the shorthand for v-on is the '@' symbol. i.e. `v-on:click` is the same as `@click`. Get a vue plugin for your ide so that the syntax doesn't throw your editor off.
    - you can apply values conditionally, eg: `:class="{ 'btn':true, 'toggled':isToggled }"`
  - v-bind (for attribute binding)
    - e.g. `<button v-bind:title="btnTitle">Hover over me</button>` ... in which the standard element attribute "title" is bound to a element in the model named 'btnTitle'.
    - the shorthand for v-bind: is the ':' symbol. i.e. `v-bind:attr` and `:attr` are the same.
  - v-if
  - v-else
  - v-show (show this element if true) : only works on dom elements, not components!!

## directives
directives take arguments, eg:
  - `v-on:click` ... "click" is the argument
  - `v-bind:attr` ... bind an element attribute named 'attr'.

## anatomy of a component:
You would create these in a .vue file.

With vetur installed, you can do `ctrl+space,t`, `ctrl+space,s` etc to get the following code snippets inserted for you. Example:
```
<template>
  
</template>

<script>
export default {
  
}
</script>

<style>

</style>
```

# components
- note that since components are not bound to an actual instance, the data attribute needs to be a *function* that returns the data obj, to be called later when the component is instantiated.
- the template must return a single root element (similar to earlier versions of react before Fragments)
- there's a *props* attribute, similar to react. Note:
 - treat ur props as immutables. Rely on *data()* and *computed()* instead if you need to modify something...
 - you don't prefix props, like `this.props.foo`. All props are placed in _this_ scope, so it's `this.foo`. !!
- component names are usually hyphenated, not camelcased. e.g. `my-component`.
- the attribute `inline-template` lets you create a component without a "template" section in the definition... because the template will be taken as whatever appears between the opening and closing tags of the component.

# component styling
- the style tag can be scoped: When a `<style>` tag has the scoped attribute, (i.e. `<style scoped>...</style>`, its CSS will apply to elements of the current component only. This is driven by postcss, under the hood.
- animations and transitions... perhaps bcos of scoped styling, these are finnickier than you'd expect. see: [this reference](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/transitions.html#Transition-Classes)

# events
- `$emit(myCustomEvtName)` will emit a custom event. Example use:
 - Example emitter: `<button @click="$emit('doTheThing')">Do it!</button>`
 - Example listener: `<MyComponent @doTheThing="foo=false"></MyComponent>`
- we can use $emitâ€˜s 2nd parameter to provide a value:
 - Example emitter: `@click="$emit('doSomething', withThisObj)"`
 - Example listener: `@doSomething="foo(withThisObj)"`


# life cycle
- mounted()


# vue-cli
```
npm install -g @vue/cli
vue create my-project
cd my-project
npm run serve #for dev
npm run build #for prod
```
